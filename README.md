## https://github.com/revanth-15/Data-Visualization/tree/revanth-15-patch-1/HomeWork1 📁 Assignment 1: Data Science Visualization and EDA

### Objective:
Conduct a thorough EDA using at least two tools among Python, R, and Excel. Clean the data, explore its distribution, and analyze correlations. Create visualizations and compare the effectiveness of the tools used.

### Key Components:
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Descriptive Statistics: Summarize central tendency and dispersion.
- Visualization Tools: Use Python, R, and/or Excel for data visualization.
- Comparative Report: Describe insights, visual comparison, and ease of use of each tool.

## 📁 Assignment 2: Terrorism Incident Analysis

### Objective:
Perform geospatial, temporal, and categorical analysis on a terrorism dataset using Python and GeoPandas/Folium/Matplotlib.

### Tasks:
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load and clean dataset.
   - Create and inspect GeoDataFrame.

2. **Geospatial Visualization**
   - Base map using Folium.
   - Choropleth map of incidents per country.
   - Heatmap of terrorist incidents.

3. **Attack Type Analysis**
   - Pie chart and bar chart for top 5 attack types.
   - Frequency count of attack types.

4. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Incidents per year line chart.
   - Seasonal decomposition to understand trends and residuals.

## 📁 Assignment 3: Interactive Visualizations using D3, Plotly, and Bokeh

### Objective:
Create interactive data visualizations using web-based libraries to explore various aspects of terrorism data.

### Visualizations:
1. **D3.js**
   - Choropleth heatmap of incidents by country.
   - Dynamic bar chart for top 10 terrorist groups with year selection.

2. **Plotly**
   - Stacked area chart of attack types over the years.
   - Toggle between stacked, grouped, and percentage views.

3. **Bokeh**
   - Interactive scatter plot for casualties vs. target types.
   - Color/size encoding and hover tooltips.
   - Year filter using range slider.

## 📁 Assignment 4: Tableau and Power BI Dashboards

### Objective:
Leverage Tableau and Power BI to uncover trends and patterns in global terrorism using interactive and multi-layered dashboards.

### Tableau Tasks:
1. World Heatmap of Terror Incidents
2. Top 10 Terrorist Groups Over Time
3. Attack Types vs. Casualties Scatter Plot
4. Monthly Trend Dashboard with cross-filtering

### Power BI Tasks:
1. Geospatial bubble map with filters
2. Attack type trends and casualty breakdowns
3. Year-over-year analysis using slicers
4. Custom dashboards integrating multiple views
